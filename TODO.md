Blog TODOs and Decisions (open)

- Units policy decision: Annotate CLI test names with units (e.g., “packed 7k tokens”, “original 1.3k lines”) or keep code as‑is and clarify in docs only?
- Future docs to consider:
  - Chunking Strategies details (mechanics, pros/cons)
  - Results Analysis details (methodology footnotes, comparator specifics)
- Optional later: Add a concise “Key Takeaways” bullet list to the Conclusion for quick scanning.
