# TODO Tracking (blog/TODO.md)

- Purpose: Capture a small set of important, high‑level goals that improve or complete `blog.md` but won’t be addressed immediately.
- Keep it brief and stable. Do not track granular edits or maintain a running checklist.
- Use it for directional items (e.g., “clarify units policy in figures,” “revisit largest chunk sizes after skipped‑lines fix”).
- Update it only when major direction changes or after substantial new results; otherwise leave as‑is.

### Items


- Units policy decision: Annotate CLI test names with units (e.g., “packed 7k tokens”, “original 1.3k lines”) or keep code as‑is and clarify in docs only?
- Future docs to consider:
  - Chunking Strategies details (mechanics, pros/cons)
  - Results Analysis details (methodology footnotes, comparator specifics)
- Optional later: Add a concise “Key Takeaways” bullet list to the Conclusion for quick scanning.
