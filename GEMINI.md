# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the source files for a blog post that analyzes the performance of different code chunking strategies for a vulnerability scanner called "fraim". The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive blog post that explains the trade-offs of each chunking strategy and provides recommendations for when to use each one.

## Key Files

*   `blog.md`: The draft of the blog post.
*   `Overview.md`: The canonical outline and structure for the blog post. This file should be consulted to understand the intended structure and content of the blog post.
*   `AGENT.md`: A guide for the AI agent, explaining how to work on the blog post. It contains important information about the project's scope, conventions, and workflow.
*   `info/`: A directory containing supporting notes, analysis, and prior summaries. This is a good place to look for more context on the different chunking strategies and the analysis of the results.
*   `results/`: A directory containing the outputs from the benchmark runs, including HTML reports and a summary in `results.md`.
*   `datasets.md`: A file that describes the datasets used for benchmarking.
*   `STYLE.md`: A style guide for the blog post.
*   `TODO.md`: A file that tracks high-level goals for the blog post.

## Usage

The primary use of this directory is to develop and maintain the blog post in `blog.md`. The `Overview.md` file should be used as a guide for the structure and content of the blog post. The `AGENT.md` file provides instructions for the AI agent on how to contribute to the project. The `info/` and `results/` directories provide the necessary context and data for the analysis presented in the blog post.

All writing and edits to the blog must follow the style guide in `./STYLE.md`. Do not copy content from the style guide into other files; reference it directly.
