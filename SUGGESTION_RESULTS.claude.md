# Results Section Simplification - Final Refined Recommendations

After reviewing all SUGGESTION_RESULTS files, here's the synthesized approach combining the strongest insights from all reviewers.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - Maximum Impact

### 1. **Lead with a 4-Line TL;DR Card** (Universal Agreement)
Place at the very top of Results section:
```markdown
## Results and Analysis

> **TL;DR**
> - **Default:** `packed 5.5–7k` for best average F1 (0.3348) and speed
> - **Precision-first:** `packed_fixed 25–30k` (0.55 precision, lower recall)
> - **Recall-first:** `packed_fixed 1–4k` (0.39 recall, noisier results)
> - **Speed on small repos:** `project` strategy (192s, competitive accuracy)
```

### 2. **Create a Single "Quick Picks" Matrix** (Codex + Gemini Consensus)
Replace sprawling narrative with actionable table:

| Goal | Recommendation | Why | Trade-off |
|------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| Best Balance | `packed 5.5–7k` | F1: 0.3348 | Mid-size only |
| Highest Precision | `packed_fixed 25–30k` | Fewer false positives | Lower recall |
| Highest Recall | `packed_fixed 1–4k` | Catches more vulnerabilities | More noise |
| Fastest Processing | `packed 6.5k` | 93s average | Dataset-dependent |
| Small Repo Speed | `project` | Whole-repo context | Memory/cost limits |
| Large Single Files | `fixed_token` | Predictable overlap | Weaker structure |

### 3. **Add Visual Decision Flow** (My Original + Codex Enhancement)
One-screen flowchart for quick decisions:
```
Need speed on small repo? ─Yes→ Use `project` (192s)
           ↓ No
Files very large? ─Yes→ Use `fixed_token` base
           ↓ No
Need max precision? ─Yes→ Use `packed_fixed 25–30k`
           ↓ No
Need max recall? ─Yes→ Use `packed_fixed 1–4k`
           ↓ No
DEFAULT → Use `packed 5.5–7k`
```

### 4. **Consolidate Method Labels Once** (Codex Priority)
Add immediately after TL;DR:
```markdown
### Method Labels Guide
- `project` = whole-repo input
- `file` = one file per chunk
- `original_*` = line-based (uses lines not tokens)
- `syntactic_*` = language-aware splits
- `fixed_token_*` = deterministic token splits
- `packed_*` = packs whole files, splits oversized with syntactic
- `packed_fixed_*` = packs whole files, splits oversized with fixed_token
```

## STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION

### 5. **Merge Overlapping Sections** (All Reviewers)
Current structure has too much redundancy. Consolidate to:

1. **TL;DR + Caveats** (4 lines + 3 one-liners)
2. **Quick Picks Matrix** (the table above)
3. **At-a-Glance Summary** (existing table, enhanced)
4. **Key Patterns** (5-6 bullets replacing 3 current sections)
5. **Dataset Behaviors** (1 line each)

### 6. **Replace Narrative with "Key Patterns" Box** (Codex)
Instead of three overlapping sections, use:
```markdown
### Key Patterns
- **Size trade-off:** Larger contexts → higher precision, lower recall
- **Sweet spot:** `packed 5.5–7k` balances accuracy and speed
- **Project surprise:** Competitive with large packed, often faster
- **Syntactic reality:** Tracks fixed-token, not consistently better
- **Dataset matters:** Cross-file vulns need more context (Juice Shop)
```

### 7. **Compress Caveats Block** (Codex)
Move methodology details to compact list after TL;DR:
```markdown
### Important Context
- Scope: Only baseline-referenced vulnerable files scanned
- Precision: Reflects within-file noise only
- Triage: Disabled for these benchmarks (improves real-world results)
```

## VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS

### 8. **Add Hero Chart** (Gemini Strong Recommendation)
Create one compelling scatter plot above iframes:
- X-axis: Processing Time
- Y-axis: F1 Score
- Bubble size: Token count
- Color: Strategy type
- Annotate: `packed 5.5k`, `project`, `packed_fixed 25k`

### 9. **Visual Legend** (Codex + Gemini)
Add before charts:
```markdown
**How to Read:** Right/up is better. Larger bubbles = more tokens.
Colors: Blue=packed, Green=fixed_token, Orange=syntactic
```

### 10. **Enhance At-a-Glance Table** (My Original)
Add recommendation badges:

| Dataset | Best F1 | Best Precision | Best Recall | Fastest | **Use Case** |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Average | `packed 5.5k` (0.33) **[DEFAULT]** | `packed_fixed 25k` (0.55) | `packed_fixed 1k` (0.39) | `packed 6.5k` | General |
| Validation | `packed 5.5k`/`23k` tie (0.47) | `project` (0.69) | `syntactic 3k` (0.54) | `packed 5.5k` | Long spans |
| Juice Shop | `packed_fixed 12k` (0.29) | `packed_fixed 25k` (0.50) | `fixed_token 1k` (0.28) | `packed_fixed 20k` | Cross-file |
| Verademo | `packed_fixed 13k` (0.34) | `packed 30k` (0.65) | `packed_fixed 4k` (0.42) | `packed_fixed 15k` | Clustered |

## DATASET NOTES (One-Liners)

### 11. **Compress Dataset Behavior** (All Reviewers)
Replace current section with:
```markdown
### Dataset Characteristics
- **Validation:** Best F1 ties at 0.4675 (`packed 5.5k` = `packed 23k`); longer spans benefit from mid-large windows
- **Juice Shop:** Hardest dataset; cross-file dependencies require balanced context
- **Verademo:** Heavy same-file clustering rewards preserving file boundaries
- **Generated:** Near-perfect (sanity check only, not decision driver)
```

## WHAT TO REMOVE

### 12. **Eliminate These Redundancies**
- Multiple mentions of "packed 5.5k being best" (keep once in TL;DR)
- Overlapping Method-Specific/Cross-Method/Expected vs Found sections
- Repeated cross-references to "see Results and Analysis"
- Verbose explanations of each metric (move to methodology)

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

1. **First:** Add TL;DR card + Quick Picks matrix (immediate value)
2. **Second:** Consolidate sections into Key Patterns (reduce confusion)
3. **Third:** Add decision flow + method labels (clarity)
4. **Fourth:** Create hero chart if time permits (visual impact)
5. **Fifth:** Polish with one-liner dataset notes and caveats

## Version and Warning Context (Codex High Priority)

Add near first results mention:
```markdown
*Results reflect fraim v0.5.1 benchmarks with triage disabled.*

> **Warning:** Running benchmarks with `--times 3` incurs API costs.
> Large contexts (25k+) can be expensive. Check your pricing tier.
```

## The Goal: One-Screen Understanding

The revised Results section should allow readers to:
1. Understand the winner in 5 seconds (TL;DR)
2. Choose their strategy in 30 seconds (Quick Picks + Flow)
3. Dive deeper if needed (Key Patterns + full data)

Current section is ~90 lines. Target: ~40 lines of core content + tables/charts.
