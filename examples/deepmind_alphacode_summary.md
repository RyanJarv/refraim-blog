# Competitive Programming with AlphaCode (Summary)

This is a summary of the DeepMind blog post "Competitive Programming with AlphaCode".

**Achievement:**
AlphaCode achieved an estimated rank within the top 54% of participants in programming competitions, solving novel problems that require critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding, and natural language understanding. This marks the first time an AI code generation system has reached a competitive level of performance.

**Methodology:**
AlphaCode uses transformer-based language models to generate code at an unprecedented scale. It then employs a filtering process to select a small set of promising programs. The model was pre-trained on selected public GitHub code and fine-tuned on a competitive programming dataset.

**Evaluation:**
Performance was validated using 10 recent contests hosted on Codeforces, a popular platform for programming competitions. AlphaCode placed at about the level of the median competitor.

**Impact:**
The authors hope their results inspire the competitive programming community and lead to further innovations in problem-solving and code generation. They also released their dataset of competitive programming problems and solutions on GitHub.

**Future:**
The article suggests that this is just the beginning for code generation and hints at future tools to enhance programming and bring closer a problem-solving AI.
