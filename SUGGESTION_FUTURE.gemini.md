# Synthesized Suggestions for a World-Class 'Conclusion and Future Work' Section

After reviewing suggestions from all sources, this document presents a synthesized and updated plan. The consensus is that the "Future Work" section can be significantly improved by making it more structured, concrete, visionary, and credible.

The core idea is to split the final section of the blog post into two distinct parts: a **Conclusion** that summarizes the past, and **Future Directions** that lays out a compelling roadmap.

---

### **Part 1: The Conclusion - What We Learned and Why It Matters**

This section should be focused, actionable, and reflective.

**1. Start with the Key Findings (Existing)**
   - Briefly reiterate the core answers to the research questions.

**2. Add a "What Surprised Us" Section (from Claude)**
   - This adds a powerful narrative element that builds trust and interest.
   - **Content:**
     - The unexpected effectiveness of the `project` strategy.
     - The fact that `syntactic` chunking didn't clearly outperform simpler methods.
     - The steepness of the precision-recall trade-off.

**3. Create a "Key Takeaways for Practitioners" Callout (from Claude)**
   - This makes the research immediately useful.
   - **Content:**
     - Start with `packed 5.5-7k`.
     - Use `project` for speed on small repos.
     - Use large contexts (`25-30k`) only when precision is paramount.
     - Emphasize that real-world triage will improve results.

### **Part 2: Future Directions - A Concrete and Visionary Roadmap**

This section should transition from findings to an exciting, tangible plan that invites community participation.

**1. Frame the Vision (from Gemini & Claude)**
   - Introduce the high-level strategic pillars for future research.
   - **Pillars:**
     - **Intelligent Adaptive Chunking:** Moving beyond static configurations.
     - **Chunker-Triager Symbiosis:** Creating a closed-loop feedback system.
     - **Multi-Model & Fine-Tuning Approaches:** Using the right model for the right job.

**2. Ground the Vision in a Concrete Roadmap (Synthesizing Codex, Claude, Gemini)**
   - For each pillar, provide specific examples of what will be built. This makes the vision credible and demonstrates a clear path forward.
   - **Example Text:**
     > Our research into **Adaptive Chunking** isn't just theoretical. Near-term work (v0.6) will involve introducing a `module-scoped` chunker to better handle cross-file context in coupled components. In the medium term (v0.7), we will implement true **AST-aware splitting** and experiment with a budget-aware policy that selects the chunking strategy based on repository signals like file size and language mix.
     >
     > We will also explore the **Chunker-Triager Symbiosis**, investigating how feedback from the triager can dynamically adjust chunking strategies for subsequent runs.

**3. Pose Open Research Questions (from Claude)**
   - After presenting the roadmap, broaden the scope to include questions that the community can engage with.
   - **Content:**
     - Can call graph analysis pre-select relevant context?
     - How do findings generalize across different LLM architectures?
     - Should vulnerability type influence context size?

**4. Add a "Limitations" Section (from Claude)**
   - This is critical for scientific honesty and credibility.
   - **Content:**
     - Acknowledge that triage was disabled.
     - Note that a single model was used.
     - Mention the limited number of datasets.

**5. End with a Clear "Call to Action" (from Gemini & Claude)**
   - Invite the community to get involved.
   - **Content:**
     - Contribute to the open-source `fraim` tool.
     - Share new and challenging datasets.
     - Join the discussion on GitHub or Slack.

### **Recommendation for `FUTURE.md`**

The highly detailed, implementation-specific suggestions from `SUGGESTION_FUTURE.codex.md` are invaluable. They should form the basis of the internal `FUTURE.md` roadmap.

- **Action:** Update `FUTURE.md` to include the near/medium/long-term roadmap, specific hypotheses, metrics, acceptance criteria, and proposed CLI flags.
- **Rationale:** This keeps the blog post narrative at a strategic level while capturing the essential engineering details for the project team. The blog post tells the "what and why," while `FUTURE.md` details the "how."
